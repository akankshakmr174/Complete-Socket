- Protocol Description for UDP and for TCP:
1) The format of the messages exchanged between client and server (see for
example how the http message format is described),
=> strings? integers operators. how do they split up?

=> Stacks separate clients..

3) How TCP server knows that expression is complete
=> when they don't get the data anymore.

4) anything else you implemented
